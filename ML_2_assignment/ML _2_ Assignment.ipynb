As the number of dimensions (features) increases, the volume of the space increases exponentially, leading to sparsity in the data. This sparsity can make it difficult for machine learning algorithms to find patterns, as the distance between points becomes less meaningful, and models may require exponentially more data to achieve reliable results. Additionally, high-dimensional spaces can lead to overfitting, where models capture noise rather than signal."

This process is repeated k times, with each subset serving as the test set once.

    "Answer: The conditional independence assumption in Naive Bayes states that, given the class label, the features are conditionally independent of each other. This means that the presence or value of one feature does not affect the presence or value of another feature, given the class. This assumption simplifies the computation of probabilities by allowing the joint probability of features to be expressed as the product of individual probabilities."

    "Answer: Smoothing in Naive Bayes refers to techniques used to handle zero probabilities for feature values that do not appear in the training data for a particular class. By adding a small constant to the counts or probabilities, smoothing ensures that no probability is zero, which prevents numerical issues and improves the robustness of the model. Common smoothing techniques include Laplace smoothing and Lidstone smoothing."
