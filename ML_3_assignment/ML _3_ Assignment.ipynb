The key idea is that by aggregating the predictions from several models, the ensemble can produce more accurate and stable predictions than any individual model.

Boosting works on the principle that a sequence of weak learners (models with slightly better than random performance) can be combined to form a strong learner. Each model in the sequence is trained to correct the mistakes made by the previous models, with the idea that difficult cases will eventually be handled correctly as the ensemble focuses more and more on them. This sequential correction process allows boosting to improve model accuracy and reduce bias."

    "Outliers can significantly impact dimensionality reduction algorithms, especially those that rely on variance or distance metrics, like PCA or t-SNE. In PCA, outliers can disproportionately influence the direction of the principal components, leading to a distorted representation of the data. This is because PCA seeks to maximize variance, and outliers can introduce extreme variance, which skews the results. Similarly, in t-SNE, outliers can affect the calculation of pairwise distances, leading to inaccurate embeddings that do not faithfully represent the local or global structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the impact of outliers, it is often necessary to perform outlier detection and removal or use robust dimensionality reduction techniques that are less sensitive to outliers, such as Robust PCA or applying techniques that focus on local structure, which are less influenced by outliers."
